# Inventory_Ordering_System
Project for a databse design module

Goal is to create a system that will persist data to a database and allow queries to be ran to that databse

Initally I am working to get the data to pesist to a file before connecting to a database 

The system will allow a user to add products of type TV or phone to a product data base 
The user can then choose to create an order for those products 
They can display all products in the system
They can search for an display a specific order 



Things to do:
Read productDB from file
Write all products to file

Read productDB from DB to productDB arrayList

Allow queries in terms of displaying all products
Display orders for specific customer
